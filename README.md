# BlockBase Whitepaper
## Abstract
Information security is paramount. It is never total, and is always subject to a tension between the need to protect it and the need to use/share it. Secure storage of data is provided through encryption, however, data is usually maintained in an unencrypted format to allow for its processing and analysis, and its access and use governed through established policies that dictate the rules for setting up a secure environment. But this relies on a human implementation of these policies and that’s where many security flaws are found. These security flaws may be exploited for information theft, for its destruction or disguised alteration, or denial of access to it. Systems that ensure, by design, the security of the information they store, and which comply with the CIA triad ("Confidentiality", "Integrity", and "Availability"), were non-existent until the creation of Bitcoin in 2008. Satoshi Nakamoto was responsible for designing a system that displayed security qualities never seen before, through the use of an innovative mixing of some well-known computer science concepts. The advent of Bitcoin led to the birth of a whole new area of research in blockchain systems, within which this project was born. Here we present BlockBase, a distributed system that applies many of blockchain related paradigms to provide secure and distributed database storage services. Traditional blockchain systems aren’t easily scalable by design and as such storing all database related operations on it is impracticable. For these reasons, a new blockchain architecture is proposed here, that relies on smart contracts for the management and operation of sidechains to a main blockchain, which in turn will serve to store those database and data operations. Each sidechain exists for the sole purpose of storing data related database operations. It stores all database management operations, such as database creation, table creation, update and deletion, column creation, update and deletion, and all data management operations, such as data insertion, update and deletion. Each sidechain is born from the agreement on a sidechain service request that specifies its servicing and financial accounting rules, which must be agreed upon by the service requester and service providers through staking of BlockBase tokens that will be lost if the rules aren’t met. All database related data is encrypted and decrypted by the service requester, without revealing any information to the service providers. The proposed implementation uses the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) extensively for data encryption and key generation. A hierarchical key generation method is proposed, that enables the sharing of access to subsets of the database, without giving access to all of its data. BlockBase requires a main blockchain that has smart contracts capabilities and that has a high throughput of blocks. After careful analysis, we chose to use the EOS blockchain for this project. BlockBase is currently in pre alpha phase.
